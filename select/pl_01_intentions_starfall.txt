What's your intentions, baby?
Do I drive you crazy?
Have you been honest lately?
Do you mind me sayin'
"I don't know how to feel?"
Is this love even real?
I don't know
No, I don't want to be alone,
it's making me sentimental
The feelings I can't control,
it always just fucks
with my mental
It's only you that knows,
I guess that you're
somebody special
But I don't know, girl,
I don't know-ooh-woah
Lately, I feel like
I'm too attached,
we're stuck in the moment
Not thinking 'bout
how we move too fast
But I kinda like it this way
Who gives a fuck what they say?
It's you and me right now, baby
Can't even think,
I've been losing track,
I'm stuck in the middle
Start thinking 'bout
how you do me like that
But I kinda like it this way
Who gives a fuck what they say?
It's you and me right now,
baby, uh-huh
What you doing?
And where you've been?
Did I miss a text back?
Are you with your friends?
Could you tell me
where you are?
Don't stay too far
You know that
I won't trip 'bout the time-ime
Close to nine, oh, please,
don't dim the lights
Can we just talk about it
over at my place?
And baby, stay the night,
oh, let me make it right
And let me tell you what
I wanted from that day,
yeah, yeah
Lately, I feel like
I'm too attached,
we're stuck in the moment
Not thinking 'bout
how we move too fast
But I kinda like it this way
Who gives a fuck what they say?
It's you and me right now, baby
Can't even think,
I've been losing track,
I'm stuck in the middle
Start thinking 'bout
how you do me like that
But I kinda like it this way
Who gives a fuck what they say?
It's you and me right now, baby
So, baby, tell me,
would you know?
(Would you notice me
if I fell apart?)
Oh, would you know?
(Would you notice me
if I fell apart?)
I might be over it all,
oh, could you look at me?
Think I might be
getting withdrawals,
why can't you look at me?
So, baby, tell me,
would you know?
(Would you notice me
if I fell apart?)
I can't get enough,
oh, would you know?
(Would you notice me
if I fell apart?)
I can't get enough of you
I might be over it all,
oh, could you look at me?
Think I might be
getting withdrawals,
why can't you look at me, baby?
Lately, I feel like
I'm too attached,
we're stuck in the moment
Not thinking 'bout
how we move too fast
But I kinda like it this way
Who gives a fuck what they say?
It's you and me right now, baby
('Cause you're still on my mind)
Can't even think,
I've been losing track,
I'm stuck in the middle
Start thinking 'bout
how you do me like that
But I kinda like it this way
Who gives a fuck what they say?
It's you and me right now,
baby, uh-huh
