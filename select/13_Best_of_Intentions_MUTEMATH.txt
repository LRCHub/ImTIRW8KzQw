I'd like to help you get those hangups under control
But I've got far too many, far too many of my own
I'd like to save you from those devils roaming your soul
But I've got far too many, far too many of my own
I wish you the best of intentions
I'll let you work it out
I wish you the best of intentions
All my best to you and yours
I want you to figure it out
It's your time to figure it out
Oh go on and figure it out
I want you to figure it out
It's time to figure it out
Your turn to figure it out
I'd like to set you free from all
Those grudges you hold
But i've got far too many, far too many of my own
I'd like to pay off all those debts you owe
But I've got far too many of my own
I wish you the best of intentions
I'll let you work it out
I wish you the best of intentions
All my best to you and yours
I want you to figure it out
It's your time to figure it out
Oh go on and figure it out
I want you to figure it out
It's time to figure it out
Your turn to figure it out
You're on your own
So long
I wish you the best of intentions
I'll let you work it out
I wish you the best of intentions
All my best to you and yours
I want you to figure it out
It's your time to figure it out
Oh go on and figure it out
I want you to figure it out
It's time to figure it out
Your turn to figure it out
I want you to figure it out
It's time to figure it out
Oh go on and figure it out
I want you to figure it out
It's time to figure it out
Go on and figure it out
