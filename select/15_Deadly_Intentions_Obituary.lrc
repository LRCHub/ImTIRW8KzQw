[00:25.91] Dead.
[00:36.98] With the rotting one below.
[00:41.80] Live.
[00:45.95] Leaving the one who died.
[00:52.55] You. Lie. You.
[01:34.35] Rotting as one.
[01:35.75] Destiny comes.
[01:37.18] Dying of this fear.
[01:40.02] Death is the one.
[01:41.22] Now he has come.
[01:42.93] Dying.
[01:44.88] The body's crying.
[01:58.83] You.
